Hi,

https://berserk.red is a shell + web hosting service

The price is 1€ per month for 1GB of space. 
(trial 0.1€ for the first month)

you can register by sending your pub key to:

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | curl -d@- https://berserk.red/register/:username
    # usernames are lowercase a-z up to 8 characters

then follow the instructions.

After you register and pay you can access it by:

    ssh username@berserk.red "echo hi > public_html/index.html"

    sftp username@berserk.red

    sshfs .. etc


All the logs about your payment/registration are stored in log/ and
are not accessible by anyone but you and me.

Please send feedback to:
